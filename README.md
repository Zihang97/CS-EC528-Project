# CS/EC528-Project

## 1. Vision and Goals Of The Project:
The Self Service Cloud-Native Data Analysis Platform is a project to build an end-to-end data analysis platform using managed services considering the tradeoffs they offer.

Goals:
- Explore the variety of managed services that exist for each component (Compute, Storage, Data Analysis, Security, and UI) and make selections based on our use-case requirements
- Develop each component using selected managed services
- Develop infrastructure that can handle an end-to-end data analysis platform use case:
  - Pull and store data in a storage solution
  - Perform transform operations and analysis on data
  - Leverage standardized data science software (Tensorflow, BigQuery, etc.)

** **

## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:
The platform will be used by data scientists with end-to-end data analysis use cases utilizing cloud technologies.

It doesnâ€™t target:
- Data scientists with strict security and compliance requirements (Ex: HIPAA)
- Data scientists with pre-defined, non-matching technology requirements

** **

## 3.   Scope and Features Of The Project:
- Programmatic infrastructure management and orchestration using Terraform
- Leverage standardized software to perform data analysis
- Provide storage solutions for user data to push/pull data from one or more sources
- Support ability to run scripts (Python) to transform and analyze data
- Security: Authorization settings to control which users can access and modify data
- Ability for multiple users to work simultaneously and independently

** **

## 4. Solution Concept
High-level outline of the solution:
- Storage for Data: Cloud-native technologies like AWS S3/GCP GCS/ DynamoDB/Spanner
- Computing Engine: Use existing IaaS solutions like AWS EC2 or GCP (can also use Container solution) 
- Data Analysis: Use data analysis platforms like Jupyter and Pandas to support machine learning codes of Tensorflow/Pytorch. (We could start simple with sklearn just to test our pipeline)
- Permission and Access Control: Provide security solutions between services and external access (Cloud IAM).  
Strech Goals:
- Front-end UI: HTML/CSS/JS for webpage and  Python Flask for web application

** **

## 5. Acceptance criteria
Minimum acceptance criteria is a self service platform that can:  
- Provide a compute environment for data analysis tasks.
- Extract data from a cloud storage service and return it.
- Support standardized data science software (tensorflow, BigQuery etc).
- Allocate storage and computation resources to ETL pipelnes based on user requirement.
- Implement security controls to enable authorization requirements 

Stretch goals include:
- Use this project to analyze Boston Open Data
- Provide several compute and size options
- Build a user friendly UI to interact with the platform

## 6.  Release Planning:
Release #1 (due by Week 5) - [Demo #1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oXEU7WKBcbGg8-MOb6BIO_EFvi4C5_9g/view?usp=sharing):
- Explore compute, storage, data anaylsis, and security managed services and technologies
- When end-users decide to upload the data, we can extract the data from their buckets and store them in our built databases.

Release #2 (due by Week 9) - [Demo #2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xs2OyQpqQeajm7Ldirc7uzXbDh8Poh07/view?usp=sharing):
- Implement storage using S3 and push and pull data
- Utilize Terraform to automate AWS infrastructure deployment
- Use Parquet and SQLite to manage data

Release #3 (due by Week 11) - [Demo #3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hF1LRp55zbktaoLSnjxkeOUE3OAvDfsb/view?usp=sharing):
- Launch a Jupyter Notebook on an EC2 container via Terraform
- Use Terraform to create storage buckets
- Expand on data analysis functionality

Release #4 (due by Week 13) - [Demo #4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tiLg_HV-MpDBvXvfWm1Wq53fKqQ_VGcF/view?usp=sharing):
- Implement security and access functionality in platform
- Use Terraform to extract and upload data in storage
- Expand on platform functionality

Release #5 (due by Week 15) - [Demo #5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DxxGCVDlaMd5ekCfQa83RFkedqxjimLA/view?usp=sharing):
